## Executive Summary

Our team has conducted an in-depth analysis of a loan default dataset of 30,000 observations and 25 variables/parameters. This somewhat popular online dataset (source: UIC) has now been downloaded more
than 700,000 times. Our primary objective was to identify patterns among customers in terms of loan repayment and determine the key variables that contribute to predicting loan default.

Additionally, knowing that most financial institutions deal with a substantial amount of data, we assessed the efficiency of the different models we run, which could be extra information for decision-makers within
the company. Also, given some findings, we aimed to provide insights into how financial institutions can effectively target customers.

We employed various modeling techniques to achieve these goals, including regression, clustering, and machine learning. We utilized logistic regression on default, LASSO regression, and principal components analysis
(PCA) in the regression category. These models allowed us to understand the relationship between the input variables and the likelihood of loan default and identify significant predictors.
In the clustering category, we applied K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithms. These techniques allowed us to group customers with similar characteristics, enabling financial institutions to
segment their customer base better and tailor their strategies accordingly.

Finally, we employed decision trees, random forests, and neural networks in the machine learning category. These models provided more profound insights into complex relationships and patterns within the dataset, enhancing our ability to predict loan default and classify customers accurately.
