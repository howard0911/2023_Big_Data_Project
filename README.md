# Loan Default Analysis

## Executive Summary

Our team conducted an in-depth analysis of a loan default dataset comprising 30,000 observations and 25 variables/parameters. This dataset, sourced from UIC, has gained popularity online, being downloaded over 700,000 times. The primary objective of our analysis was to identify patterns among customers regarding loan repayment and determine the key variables contributing to predicting loan default.

Additionally, we evaluated the efficiency of various models to provide extra information for decision-makers within financial institutions. Based on our findings, we also aimed to offer insights on how these institutions can effectively target customers.

## Objectives

1. Identify key variables predicting loan default.
2. Analyze patterns among customers in terms of loan repayment.
3. Evaluate the efficiency of different models.
4. Provide actionable insights for financial institutions.

## Methodology

We employed various modeling techniques, categorized into regression, clustering, and machine learning:

### Regression Techniques

- **Logistic Regression on Default**: To understand the relationship between input variables and the likelihood of loan default.
- **LASSO Regression**: For variable selection and regularization to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**: To reduce dimensionality and identify significant predictors.

### Clustering Techniques

- **K-Means Clustering**: To group customers with similar characteristics.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: To create a hierarchy of clusters for better segmentation.

### Machine Learning Techniques

- **Decision Trees**: To uncover complex relationships and patterns.
- **Random Forests**: To enhance prediction accuracy through ensemble learning.
- **Neural Networks**: To model intricate patterns and improve classification accuracy.

## Results and Insights

- Identified significant predictors of loan default.
- Segmented customers into distinct groups based on repayment patterns.
- Evaluated model performance to recommend efficient approaches for prediction and classification.

## Conclusion

Our analysis provides valuable insights into loan default patterns and predictive variables, offering financial institutions a data-driven approach to target customers effectively. The evaluation of various models highlights the importance of choosing the right technique based on the specific requirements and context of the analysis.
